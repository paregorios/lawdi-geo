#
# The triples contained in this file are an attempt to make some semantic
# assertions about a Roman inscription from Tripolitania. That inscription
# was most recently published in the digital version of Joyce Reynold's 
# Inscriptions of Roman Tripolitania at this URL:
#
#     http://irt.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/IRT264.html
#
# No RDF was included with the publication, so we're just making assertions
# from outside the publishing context.

# it would be nice to be able to make some assertions about the inscription
# itself and the relationship of the HTML edition against it, but without
# IRT minting a URI for the inscription itself, the following can't be
# done:
# <http://irt.kcl.ac.uk/irt2009/IRT264#this> a <http://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/instances/synset-inscription-noun-1>;
